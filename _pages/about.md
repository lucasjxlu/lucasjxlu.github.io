I am a senior undergraduate at the **University of Washington, Seattle**, studying **Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics**. I am most interested in **machine learning**, **quantitative finance**, and **algebraic topology**.

I am currently completing an honors research project under the supervision of **Prof. Gordon Watts** in the Department of Physics. The project explores the use of **normalizing flows**, a class of deep generative models, to learn the distribution of **jets** from the **ATLAS experiment** at CERN. In high-energy particle collisions, jets are collimated sprays of particles produced by quarks and gluons, and their detailed structure encodes information about the underlying physical processes. By learning jet-level patterns, the model aims to accurately reconstruct the **top quark mass** from experimental data.

In addition to research, I write about mathematics for a general audience on **Medium**, where I focus on building intuition for abstract concepts. I am currently working on a series introducing ideas from **abstract algebra**.

Outside of academics, I enjoy **photography**, especially landscapes photography. Recently I also started learning astrophotography. You can find some of my photos on my Pixieset portfolio.
