Rubik’s Cubes are among the most popular puzzles in the world. A standard Rubik’s Cube has six faces, each painted a different color. The most common version is the 3 × 3 × 3 cube, meaning it is three-dimensional, with three layers along each axis that can be independently rotated.

I’ll assume you already have a basic, intuitive understanding of how a Rubik’s Cube works physically. With that in mind, the image below illustrates the seven basic types of moves you can perform on the cube.

The labels $R$, $L$, $U$, $D$, $B$, and $F$ stand for right, left, up, down, back, and front, respectively. Each label simply indicates which face of the cube is being turned, with each move representing a 90-degree rotation (as you can tell from the colors).
